- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dimethylebutane
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics/mechatronics
- 🌱 I’m currently a Student at Arts et Métiers, and Université Paris Saclay (M1 in electronics)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reducing greenhouse gases emmisions :)
- 📫 How to reach me: gregoire.dreno@gadz.org

I've learned programming because pointers are fun to play with, and yes I've never finished any project because my brain was overheating only by opening them.
